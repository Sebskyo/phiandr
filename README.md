# φ&r
*A game about circular movement*
*Pronounced "phi and r"*
## What is φ&r?
### The game itself
φ&r is a traditional small "move about to avoid falling things", except it is plotted on a [polar coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system).
### The more technical stuff
φ&r is entirely written in Java (yes Java, the language everyone loves to hate) using the [Slick2D]() library, which itself builds upon [LWJGL 2]().
## How do I download this?
Easy, go to the releases page, and choose one of the downloads. All executables are called "phiandr.jar".
## How do I play?
### "I'm good at games!"
Use the usual buttons, you should be able to figure it out
### "I'm incredibly bad at games!"
In the menu, press enter or click the circle to begin the game. Once there, you use the arrow keys to move. You lose when one of the smaller circles hit you, after that you are shown your score and a countdown until you are brought back to the menu.
### "I'm literally retarded!"
I'm asuming you can read and have read the above guide, so here's a list of what the specific arrow keys do:
* Left: move counter-clockwise
* Right: move clockwise
* Up: move away from the center
* Down: move closer to the center
